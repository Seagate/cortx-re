GitHub Actions Workflow
=======================

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows directly in your repository. GitHub Actions helps you to automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code, and collaborate on pull requests and issues. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code.

For complete information on GitHub actions workflow, refer `GitHub Actions Workflow <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_.
